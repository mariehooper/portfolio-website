biggest_challenge: The hardest part about maintaining this reference guide is keeping it organized enough for a developer to easily find the answer to a specific question like how to make a certain UI component accessible. As I was learning more about accessibility in order to make sure that GradeCraft was WCAG compliant, I realized that materials about accessibility are scattered all over the internet and many of them don't do a great job of explaining what to add to your codebase. I added a 'practical examples' section to my table of contents for this reason.

best_thing_i_learned: My biggest takeaway in this process was that the best thing you can to improve the accessibility of your web app is to start with semantic HTML. If we as developers can avoid 'div soup' and use the intended elements for the job like real buttons and appropriate headings, we can save ourselves a lot of added code and ultimately make the user experience better for everyone.

up_next: The next phase of this reference guide is simply to expand it to include more common UI components and share it out with my colleagues!

challenge: Create a single source of information related to accessibility so that developers are more likely to build accessibility considertations into their apps from the start.

process: Find industry best practices for creating accessible UI components and organize them in a way that is easy to browse and implement.

solution: A GitHub repo with resources and code snippets for developers to reference while they work.
